This was a project developed as part of the Ignite Course, from RocketSeat.
The original project can be seen on https://github.com/rocketseat-education/ignite-template-reactjs-refactoring-classes-ts.

The code was me by refactoring a class based React page into a function based one while also converting the Javascript pages into Typescript.
